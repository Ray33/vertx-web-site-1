### Eclipse Vert.x and reactive in just a few words

Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building _reactive_ applications on the JVM.

Reactive applications are both _scalable_ as workloads grow, and _resilient_ when failures arise.

A reactive application is _responsive_ as it keeps latency under control by making efficient usage of system resources, and by protecting itself from errors.

Vert.x is backed by a large ecosystem of reactive modules with just anything you need when writing modern services: a comprehansive web stack, reactive database drivers, messaging, event streams, clustering, metrics, distributed tracing and more.

Vert.x is a toolkit and not a framework that ships with black magic: _what you write is actually what you get to execute_, as simple as that.

So what makes Vert.x a great option for writing your next _cloud-native_ or _[twelve=factor](https://12factor.net/)_ app?

### In the beginning there were threads...

The classic approach to concurrency is to use _threads_.

Multiple threads can live within a single _process_, perform _concurrent_ work, and _share_ the same memory space.

Most application and service development frameworks are based on multi-threading.

On the surface the model of having _1 thread per connection_ is reassuring because developers can rely on traditional _imperative style_ code.

This is fine, especially if you forget about those silly mistakes you can make with multi-threading and memory access...

### Multi-threading is "simple" but limited

What happens as the workload grows beyond moderate workloads?
[(see the C10k problem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem)

The answer is simple: you start making your operating system kernel _suffer_ because there is too much _context switching_ work with in-flight requests.

**IMAGE HERE with threads being blocked**

Some of your threads will be _blocked_ because they are waiting on I/O operations to complete, some will be _ready_ to handle I/O results, and some will be in the middle of doing CPU-intensive tasks.

Modern kernels have very good schedulers, but you cannot expect them to deal with 50 000 threads as easily as they would do with 5000.

Also threads aren't cheap: creating a thread takes a few milliseconds, and a new thread eats about 1MB of memory.

### Asynchronous programming: scalability and resource efficiency

Processing more concurrent connections with less threads is possible when you use _asynchronous I/O_.

Instead of blocking a thread when an I/O operation occurs, we move on to another task which is ready to progress, and resume the initial task later when it is ready.

Vert.x multiplexes concurrent workloads using _event-loops_.

**IMAGE HERE with an event loop**

Code that runs on event-loops shall not perform blocking I/O or lengthy processing but don't worry if you have such code: Vert.x has worker threads and APIs to process events back on an event-loop.

### Pick the best asynchronous programming model for your problem domain

We know that asynchronous programming requires more efforts.
At the core of Vert.x we support _callbacks_ and _promises / futures_, the later being a simple and elegant model for chaining asynchronous operations.

Advanced reactive programming is possible with [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), and if you prefer something closer to traditional imperative programming then we are happy to provide you with first-class support of [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).

**IMAGE HERE (or not?)**

Vert.x supports many asynchronous programming models: choose what works best for each problem you need to solve!
